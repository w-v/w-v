browse it [here](http://diiscogs.w-v.fr)
the code is on my [github](https://github.com/w-v/diiscogs)

## What is it ?

It's a web app for browsing the [discogs.com](http://discogs.com) database.
discogs.com is a user-made database of music releases (albums, singles, EPs, etc.) The database is available in xml (over 30GB) and has over 350m entries.

This is a school project I did for a datastructure module during the 2nd year of my Computer Science degree.

The projects' goal was to import it in a MySQL database and build a web app for browsing it.

## How was it done

The most difficult and tedious part was to import and clean up the database.

The XML [(available here)](http://data.discogs.com/), is as big as 30G.
Without at least 32G of RAM, it is impossible to open it.
