the [snblabla](wiki) is an 8-bit sound chip that was used in the Megadrive and other old game consoles and arcades.
it's got 3 channels and a white noise channel for percussion. it sounds very much like old video games.
This project's goal is to make an alarm clock with it.

#Hardware and setup

I've used :
	- an Arduino
	- an SNblabla
	- a 7-segment 4 digits display
	- 2 shift refisters 74595
	- an RTC

	- some battery pack
	- some push and self-locking buttons
	- some caps and resistors
here is the schema

the shift registers are used to reduce the number of outputs from the Arduino
the one on the sound chip simply gets 8 bits and latches it to the chip
the other one on the display simply lights all the segments one after another. Ive put a cap between the clock and the latch because only one bit is latched at a time, and the numbet of outputs is limited
