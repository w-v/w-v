## What is it ?

It's a web app for browsing the [discogs.com](http://discogs.com) database.
discogs.com is a user-created database of music releases (albums, singles, EPs, etc.) The database is available in xml (over 30GB) and has over 350m entries.

This is a school project I did for a datastructure module during the 2nd year of my Computer Science degree.

The projects' goal was to import it in a MySQL database and build a web app for browsing it.

## How was it done

The most difficult and tedious part was to get and clean up the database.
So it's available in xml [here](http://data.discogs.com/), and the biggest file is 30G.
At first I thought I could just parse it the normal way, but with 4G of RAM, it wasn't gonna happen.
Then I looked into streams and various ways to solve the problem, and then I found a [github repository](https://github.com/korcstar/php-discogsTomysql) that just did that in PHP. The import takes a good 3 days on an average machine with a good MySQL connection.
It saved me a lot of time, and I am very grateful for this work.
However the data imported was raw, the schema followed exactly how things were arranged in the XML
